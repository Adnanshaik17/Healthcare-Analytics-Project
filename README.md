# ü©∫ Healthcare Analytics Using SQL and Power BI

## üìå 1. Project Title

**Healthcare Cost & Utilization Analysis**  
Capstone Project ‚Äì LearnBay Data Analytics Program

---

## üìù 2. Description

This project focuses on uncovering financial inefficiencies and care utilization patterns within a simulated healthcare environment. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, the analysis delivers actionable insights into high-cost patients, underperforming payers, and regional cost hotspots.

---

## üìö 3. Data Source and Information

The dataset was provided by LearnBay as part of the Data Analytics Capstone program. It includes multiple CSV files representing real-world healthcare entities:

- **Patients:** Demographic details like ID, gender, and birthdate
- **Encounters:** Medical visits with class, cost, diagnosis, and duration
- **Procedures:** Medical procedures performed with cost and timestamps
- **Payers:** Insurance providers and their coverage contributions
- **Organizations:** Hospital and clinic names with city, state, and coordinates
- **Data Dictionary:** Explanation of schema and field definitions

---

## üß∞ 4. Tech Stack Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** for querying, data cleaning, and logic building  
- **Power BI** for dashboard development, charts, and KPIs  
- **Power Query** for ETL operations and data shaping  
- **DAX** for custom calculations, conditional logic, and measure building  

---

## üåü 5. Features and Highlights

### A. Business Problems Addressed

- Analyze cost distribution across different encounter types  
- Identify patients with frequent, high-cost encounters  
- Detect gaps between total claim cost and insurance coverage  
- Track procedure cost trends by diagnosis  
- Visualize regional patterns in healthcare delivery and expense  
- Measure encounter durations across classes and organizations

---

### B. Goal of SQL Analysis and Dashboard

The goal was to generate high-value business insights from healthcare data, using SQL to prepare and query the data, and Power BI to present findings in an executive-ready visual format. The analysis targets operational inefficiencies, financial risks, and care optimization opportunities.

---

### C. KPI and Chart Requirements

Four key KPIs were created:  
- Total Claim Cost  
- Average Claim Cost  
- Total Uncovered Cost  
- Total High-Cost Patients  

Visualizations include pie charts, bar graphs, matrix tables, maps, and line charts to track claim patterns, payer performance, encounter cost trends, and more.

---

### D. Walkthrough of Key Visuals

- **Matrix visuals** show payer coverage vs. uncovered cost by diagnosis  
- **Bar charts** highlight which encounter classes and procedures are most costly  
- **Pie charts** break down cost contribution by payer  
- **Maps** display average costs and patient traffic by organization and location  
- **KPI cards** deliver real-time summary metrics of the system's cost burden

---

### E. Business Impact and Insights

- Ambulatory encounters, while low in individual cost, drive up system expense due to high volume  
- A small group of patients generates repeated high-cost claims, highlighting a need for care management  
- Payers like Anthem and Cigna have large uncovered costs, posing financial risks  
- Mental health and maternity care are frequently underfunded despite consistent use  
- Smaller cities show disproportionately high per-visit costs, indicating emergency-only care reliance
